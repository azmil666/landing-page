## Overview

This project focuses on **UI clarity, motion discipline, and responsive behavior**, rather than heavy visuals or gimmicks.
Animations are intentional, minimal, and tied to user interaction — creating a calm but premium experience.

The design adapts cleanly across desktop and mobile while maintaining visual hierarchy and brand consistency.

## Design Goals

* Reflect **Google’s friendly yet professional design language**
* Keep motion **subtle, purposeful, and performance-safe**
* Maintain **visual breathing space** and readable structure
* Avoid over-animation or distracting effects
* Deliver a landing page that feels **official, not experimental**

---

## Key Features

* Fully responsive layout (desktop & mobile optimized)
* Hero section with subtle 3D-style breathing animation
* Floating pill elements on desktop with hover interaction
* Interactive logo pill in the welcome section
* Consistent hover feedback across buttons and cards
* Animated icons that respond on hover
* Google four-color hover scheme (blue, red, yellow, green)
* Clean footer with structured navigation and contact info

---

## UI / UX Notes
